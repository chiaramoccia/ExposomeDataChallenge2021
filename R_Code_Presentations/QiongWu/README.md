## A new statistical graph model to systematically study associations between multivariate exposome data and multivariate metabolomics data

We focus on the parsimonious multivariate-multivariate association pattern detection, which is to select a set(s) of exposures and a set(s) of accordingly  affected metabolites.  

# Codes

"greedy_bipar.m" to maximize the proposed generalized density metric
"greedy_lik_fun.m" to select the tunning parameter via likelihood
"Output_figures.html" for the whole procedure

# Slides
Please refer to slides of the talk "isglobal_QW.pdf" for details.
