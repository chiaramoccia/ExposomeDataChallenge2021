This folder is intended to share R code of selected presentations. Each presenter should:
  
1. Fork the repository;
2. Add a folder into the current folder [R_Code_Presentations](https://github.com/isglobal-exposomeHub/ExposomeDataChallenge2021/tree/main/R_Code_Presentations) with his/her name;
3. Add the R code, .Rmd files, vignettes or whatever other file it is required to reproduce the presented results into that new folder;
4. Make a pull request.
