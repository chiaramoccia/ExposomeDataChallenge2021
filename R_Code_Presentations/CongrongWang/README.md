# Biopic of the working group
Our team includes 5 researchers: T. Nawrot, M. Plusquin, B. Reimann (epidemiologists), R. Alfano (MD), and C. Wang (statistician). We study the health effects of the exposome in early life, with a specific interest in biological mechanisms mediating these effects using large-scale data including in our ENVIRONAGE cohort.
As we have experience in the analysis of OMICs, multi-OMICs integration, multipollutant models and statistical approaches to infer causality including mediation and structural equation modelling we are highly motivated for this challenge. Our work within the STOP (H2020) project on birth weight and childhood obesity puts us in an ideal place to study childhood BMI.


# Abstract study proposal

## Meet-in-the-middle meets multi-omics: a strategy to identify molecular signatures of environmental drivers of childhood BMI
Environmental exposures have been recently linked with childhood obesity in the [HELIX study](http://www.projecthelix.eu/), and we aim for a strategic use of multiple data layers to interrelate underlying obesogenic mechanisms. 
We propose a multi-step meet-in-the-middle strategy to identify childhood multi-omics signatures (plasma and urine metabolome, blood transcriptome, and blood methylome) associated with both the exposome (pre- and postnatal exposures) and childhood BMI. Firstly, we apply an unsupervised modeling method, [Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA)](https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/), to infer sparse latent factors from multi-omics (N=1198), extract and select relevant downstream features and regress them against childhood BMI (reduced multi-omics). Secondly, MOFA is applied to the exposome (N=1301) using the same technique and downstream analyses are performed to identify the exposome associated with the reduced multi-omics (reduced exposome). MOFA enables integration across different data modalities and is robust to the presence of missing values, but it has the limitation to not provide a mechanistic framework suggesting a sequence of linked events.
